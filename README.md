# ActiveWindowsStat
This program identifies active window every second and get the name of its process. The name is written to a text file $iniFile in INI format in section “processes” like this: name of a process = seconds count. The only way to end this program is to kill its process in task manager. ActiveWindowsStat does not have graphical user interface and needs minimum computer performance.
